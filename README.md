<p align="center">
    A <b>configuration library</b> for games that enables<br/><b>fast</b> and <b>expressive</b> iteration with <b>YAML</b> and <b>JSON</b>.
</p>

## üéØ Features
* Reduce iteration time to seconds.  Hotload game data and see changes immediately in a running game.
* Get up and running quickly, and add config support to any class with near zero boilerplate.
* Write expressive, readable, concise configs with YAML's flexible syntax.
* Find content problems quickly with helpful error messages that include filenames, line, and column numbers.
* Supports a wide range of devices and Unity versions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Add `DarkConfig.dll` and `YamlDotNet.dll` to your project.
```C#
// Tell DarkConfig where to find yaml files
Configs.AddConfigSource(new FileSource("path/to/your/yaml/files/"));

// Load and parse all the yaml config files
Configs.Preload();

// Set the fields of the myConfigValueType object with the data from myConfig.yaml file.
Configs.Apply("myConfig", myConfigValueType);
```

## üí° Concept

DarkConfig converts YAML into C# types, and can update the C# values when config files change.  This is done using reflection, so very little glue code is needed.

Given this object:

``` C#
public class Spinner : MonoBehaviour {
    string Name;
    public Dictionary<string, KeyCode> Keyboard;

    void Start() {
        Config.ApplyThis("player", this);
    }

    void Update() {
        float rotation = 0;

        if (Input.GetKey(Keyboard["Left"])) {
            rotation += 10;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey(Keyboard["Right"])) {
            rotation -= 10;
        }

        transform.rotation *= Quaternion.AngleAxis(rotation * Time.deltaTime, Vector3.forward);
    }
}
```

And this file:
``` yaml
---   # player.bytes
Name: PlayerName
Keyboard:
    Left: LeftArrow
    Right: RightArrow
```

You now have a configurable control mapping system. Any changes that you make in player.bytes will automatically update the values in the current instances of Spinner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integration

DarkConfig is built as a single DLL which depends on YamlDotNet.  The integration process is straightforward but differs slightly depending on the platform

### dotnet core or Visual Studio

1. Grab the `DarkConfig.dll` and `YamlDotNet.dll` from the latest release and add them as a dependency of your csproj.

### Unity

1. Grab the `DarkConfig.dll` and `YamlDotNet.dll` from the latest release and put them in `Plugins/`.
1. Copy the folder `demo/Assets/DarkConfig/` and also place it in `Plugins/`. This contains required Unity-specific DarkConfig code.
1. Add the following code somewhere in game startup:
```C#
UnityPlatform.Setup();
Config.AddConfigSource(new ResourcesSource(hotload: true));
Config.Preload();
```

Unity quirks:
* DarkConfig by default expects its config files in the `Assets/Resources/Configs` directory.  Unfortunately, configuration files need to have a `.bytes` extension, otherwise Unity will not treat them as text data.  E.g. `Assets/Resources/Configs/player.bytes`. This isn't a huge deal in DarkConfig, because you normally refer to files by their name without extension. e.g. simply `player` for `Assets/Resources/Configs/player.bytes`.
* Unity doesn't have an easy way to discover files in `Resources/` at runtime. Instead, DarkConfig generates the list of available config files at edit-time and stores it in a file named `index.bytes`. You can re-generate this file by with the "_Assets -> DarkConfig -> Autogenerate Index_" menu item.
* 

Tips:

* You can't access any config files until preloading is complete, so it's best to delay any other code running until Preload is complete. In our projects, we typically have a "Loader" scene that loads the config files before proceeding with the rest of the game.  See the demo project for an example.
* If you're using a configs path that's _not_ `Resources/Configs`, you'll need to edit the search path for `index.yaml` by setting the path in `Plugins/DarkConfig/Editor/EditorUtils.cs`


## üß± Building Objects From Configs


There are two entry points for using configuration files to build up in-memory object structures.

### Apply:

The convenient Apply function accepts a filename and an object, and wires up the object immediately, and also sets up a listener to hot reload changes onto the object.  The code for this is simple:

```C#
Config.Apply("spinner", ref spinnerInstance);
```

The hot reloading callback uses a weak reference in order to avoid leaking memory.  If the `spinnerInstance` object is garbage collected, or if it's a MonoBehaviour that gets destroyed, it won't continue to take up space.

It's absolutely fine to Apply the same file to different objects.

### DocNode:

You can save the DocNode to an instance variable and access it in a dynamically-typed way:

```C#
DocNode SpinnerConfig;

void Awake() {
    Config.Apply("spinner", ref SpinnerConfig);
}

void Update() {
    spinnerInstance.spinRate = SpinnerConfig["spin_rate"].AsFloat();
    spinnerInstance.complexVar = SpinnerConfig["positions"]["enemy"].As<List<Vector2>>();
}
```

The DocNode will throw an exception if the typing is wrong at runtime (e.g. you're trying to access it as if it's a dictionary but in the YAML it's a list).  There's more documentation on how to use DocNodes in Docs/docnode.md


## üî• Hotloading in Standalone Unity Builds

[TODO: this is mostly correct but I haven't messed with this in a while so I don't remember if this works with ResourcesSource or if it requires FileSource]

DarkConfig supports hotloading configs for standalone builds.  This is a useful setup when you're making quick tweaks, or even as a full workflow when it's easier to share the build than the project.  By default, it expects these files to be in a "Configs" directory, which is placed at these locations:
    * Windows Standalone: within the _Data folder
    * Mac OS Standalone: within the .app/Contents folder

You have to manually copy the files to those locations when you make those types of builds.


## üßò Best Practices

Use hot reloading to your advantage.  Seeing the results of your changes quickly is essential for game design iteration. While DarkConfig does a lot to help you do this, it can't do everything.

* Don't copy values off of objects that are managed by DarkConfig.  Once you've copied the value of a variable, the copy won't be updated by DarkConfig when the corresponding config file changes.  Instead, pass a reference to the object managed by DarkConfig and refer to the fields on it directly.  See the PlaneCard structure in the demo for an example of what that looks like.
* If you must copy values, set up listeners to take action when the config-driven values change. For example, you might have to do this if you're setting the position on a Transform. You can use the PostDoc technique to do this. See the documentation in `Docs/types.md` for more detailed information, and the class PlaneCard in the demo for an example.


## üîí Security

Whenever you're reading files, there's a chance that they could be maliciously constructed.  In the past people have [devised exploits](https://www.sitepoint.com/anatomy-of-an-exploit-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rails-yaml-vulnerability/) that use a malicious YAML file to execute code within the process that is reading the file.  While we're not aware of any such exploits affecting DarkConfig, we also haven't done the work necessary to demonstrate that it's resistant to them.

Thus far, we've only deployed DarkConfig for loading configs we author, on player computers/phones.  In these situations, the worst case of file tampering means that the player gets control over a local process which they already had complete access to, so in our opinion the risk of a malicious YAML file does not increase the overall security risk.

We do not recommend using DarkConfig to seed a user-generated-content engine, where players load files created by others.  That introduces the risk that a malicious file gets distributed to many computers and does something bad to them.  For similar reasons, we also don't recommend loading files authored by untrusted sources on computers that you own.  It would not be wise to implement a modding engine using DarkConfig.


## ü¶ä A Note From The Spry Foxes

When we were first discussing what license to use for DarkConfig, we initially leaned towards writing one of our own that would allow people to use DarkConfig for free, as they desired and without any limitation, with the sole exception that DarkConfig could not be used in any game that was substantially similar to an existing game (i.e. a clone). This is an issue that we feel strongly about; making financially successful, original video games is extremely difficult, and we want to help other developers do it without simultaneously giving a speed boost to the many predatory companies that already rip off other devs with depressingly great alacrity. However, we ultimately decided that such a license would cause too much confusion and uncertainty and would stop legitimate devs from using DarkConfig, so we gave up on the idea. 

That is why we decided to use the simple 3 paragraph BSD open source license for the project; because it is short, easy to understand, and highly permissive. However, we also decided to add a single sentence to the license about crediting Spry Fox for our contribution to games that use DarkConfig. We had originally not planned to do this, but we can't resist making a statement (if not a statement in support of original game development, then perhaps another!) Our statement is simple: people deserve credit for their work, and that includes us. The game industry has a long and unfortunate history of individual contributors being excluded from the credits of games that they worked long and hard on. This issue is commonplace enough that the IGDA has for many years now maintained a "crediting standards" guide, in hopes of encouraging better behavior from studios and publishers. TLDR: we put a lot of work into DarkConfig and we don't think it's too much to ask for a polite nod in your credits page in return... and we hope you'll do the right thing and acknowledge every other contributor to your game there as well!

That's probably more than enough preaching from us. Thanks for reading this far! We just want to sign off with this: if you're using DarkConfig to make an original game that hopefully brings a little more happiness into the world, please know that everyone at Spry Fox thinks you are wonderful and we wish you all the success and joy you could ever hope for. :-)  

Love,
All the Spry Foxes
