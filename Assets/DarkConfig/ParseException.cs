    /// the innermost exception, and working outwards. So this instead makes it
    /// more readable by putting all the messages up top, and then all the
    /// stack traces in a big line, still from inner at the top to outer at the
    /// bottom.  It's a bit more readable, and most importantly the line
    /// numbers in the config files are much more prominent.
